# frostbyte

Welcome to frostbyte, a web proxy built to unblock websites on devices that have web restrictions.

## About

frostbyte is a simple but powerful proxy that allows you to browse the web without restrictions. It uses Ultraviolet proxy technology to bypass web filters and access blocked content.

## Features

- Clean, centered search interface
- DuckDuckGo search integration
- Ultraviolet proxy for bypassing restrictions
- Modern, responsive design

## Hosting Requirements

**Important:** frostbyte requires a non-static hosting provider to function properly. You **cannot** host this on static hosting providers like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

### Recommended Hosting Providers:
- Render
- Railway
- Heroku
- Any VPS (Virtual Private Server)
- Node.js hosting platforms

Static hosting providers will not work because frostbyte requires server-side processing for the proxy functionality.
